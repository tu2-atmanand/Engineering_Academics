# Software Analysis

### 1. ModelSim
This is like the king of simulation, most of the other Software whose GUI may be good use this simulation engine as backEnd. So only nice engine, and actually the only engine i have for lightweight simulation. But the GUI is very bad, very laggy, not responsive, Also the simulation process is very long and bad and the text editor is also very bad.
One more con of this, it creates .bak files for each of the edited file, and creates complete mess in the working directory.

### 2. VHDPlus
This is very nice good looking, it solves the Text editor problem from ModelSim, but for when press simulate loads the same window, which is laggy, but good dark looking though.
> i have to see if its possible to see the waves in this Software itself.

### 3. Aldec Active-HDL
This has solved all the problems of ModelSim as of now. It also not uses the ModelSim i have installed in C: drive, it has its own backEnd ModelSim installed which is 20.1 though, its latest compiler SystemVerilog 13 or something.

TODO : There is possibility of configuring Block level sysnthesis and Physical sysnthesis tools in this so might go beyond very well.

Cons : Only con is some features like advanced waveform and other are not included in this student edition.

# Top 11 EDA Tools in VLSI
EDA is an abbreviation for electronic design automation. It is a software application that is used to develop electronic circuits. To ease the designing of integrated circuits on a large scale, companies use EDA tools. EDA tools in VLSI help the VLSI engineers to design chips  For various electronic applications such as processors for mobile and laptops. There are several EDA tools in the VLSI industry. Let us walk through a few EDA companies and their tools useful for the synthesis, implementation and simulation of electronic circuits. Some EDA tools are free to use, while others require a license.
