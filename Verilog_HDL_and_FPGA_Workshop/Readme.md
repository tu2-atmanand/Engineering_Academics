# Verilo_HDL_and_FPGA_Design_Flow_Workshop

This is the FPGA Designing and HDL Programming wokshop i attended. This repo contains all the designs i created in the workshop.

Each file has its corresponding design as per the name. As well as at the end of the file, it contains the respective TestBench for that particular task or module which is commented out.

I used Active-HDL student edition by Aldec. Its much simple to use and simulate in this. Create a file, write your main code and TestBench in the same file. And select and run the TestBench module under the file in the files explorer tab.

I have used several other Simulating softwares, and have done some analysis on pros and cons for them, you can check it here.

### How to run (In other Simulators)
1. Compile the File you want to run.
2. Copy the commented test bench in a separate new file. (without the comment)
3. Compile this new file
4. Simulate the TestBench module as per the name.
